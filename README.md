# hashcode2018

So, this was for some university coursework, where we were challenged to complete Google's Hashcode from 2018.

Stage 1 was about having our program read from a file provided by our lecturers, ourselves and Google and making sure our program 
calculates the correct score.

Stage 2 was about creating a program to get the highest score possible from a layout. I'll need to rerun my simulations when I get a moment
so bare with me and I'll update my scores!
